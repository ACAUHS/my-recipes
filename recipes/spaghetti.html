    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Back when I lived with my parents, my Dad would always make this
       spaghetti recipe whenever it was a special occasion. Although it's not
       considered a traditional spaghetti recipe, it's definitely one of my 
       favourite variations on the dish. The main difference in this recipe
       however, is the addition of banana ketchup in the sauce. I promise
       it does not taste as disgusting as it sounds, and instead it adds
       a bit of sweetness/tang to the recipe, that you wouldn't normally get
       with a traditional recipe. I wouldn't completely classify it as 
       Filipino spaghetti though, considering how that is very sweet and usually
       has the addition of sausages.
